#Practice CT 401 Compute Income Tax
#Instructions:

#This is a graded activity. After you have completed the exercise, on the bottom of the last page of instructions, click the "Mark as Completed" button to submit your work for review.
#For this final project, itâ€™s time to put into practice everything we have covered in this course.
#Write a program that asks the user to input his or her taxable income (expressed as a positive integer) and prints the amount of federal income tax they owe.
#The table below contains sample federal income tax brackets:
#Federal Income Tax Rates:
#Tax Rate
#Taxable income bracket
#Tax owed
#10%	$0 to $9,700	10% of taxable income
#12%	$9,701 to $39,475	$970.00 plus 12% of the amount over $9,700
#22%	$39,476 to $84,200	$4,543.00 plus 22% of the amount over $39,475
#24%	$84,201 to $160,725	$14,382.50 plus 24% of the amount over $84,200
#32%	$160,726 to $204,100	$32,748.50 plus 32% of the amount over $160,725
#35%	$204,101 to $510,300	$46,628.50 plus 35% of the amount over $204,100
#37%	$510,301 or more	$153,798.50 plus 37% of the amount over $510,300
#Your program should use the information contained in this table to compute the tax owed for the different tax brackets.
#Your program will:
#Ask the user to input his or her yearly income
#Compute how much tax is owed
#Output that amount to the user
#Hint: This is a more complex project than you have previously done. Take it in stages. One approach may be to start by writing a program that assumes the user's income is in the lowest (10%) bracket, computes the tax owed, and prints it. Test your work by running your program. If it works, then continue by modifying the program to add the second (15%) bracket: first decide whether the income falls in the 10% or 15% bracket, and then compute the tax owed accordingly. Continue to test your code by running the exercise.py from the terminal, and continue until you have included all tax brackets successfully.
#Sample output:
#Enter your income: [user enters 35075]
#Tax due: $4015.0

income = int(input('What is your yearly income?'))
